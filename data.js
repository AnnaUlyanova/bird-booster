    description: "Known for its friendly ‘cheet cheet’ call and energetic flying antics, the aptly named fantail is one of the most common and widely distributed native birds on the New Zealand mainland. It is easily recognised by its long tail which opens to a fan. It has a small head and bill and has two colour forms, pied and melanistic or black. The pied birds are grey-brown with white and black bands. The fantail is widespread throughout New Zealand and its offshore islands, including the Chatham Islands and Snares Islands. It is common in most regions of the country, except in the dry, open country of inland Marlborough and Central Otago, where frosts and snow falls are too harsh for it. It also breeds widely in Australia and some Pacific Islands. The fantail is one of the few native bird species in New Zealand that has been able to adapt to an environment greatly altered by humans. Originally a bird of open native forests and scrub, it is now also found in exotic plantation forests, in orchards and in gardens. At times, fantails may appear far from any large stands of shrubs or trees, and it has an altitudinal range that extends from sea level to the snow line."

    description: "The weka is a large, brown flightless bird that has a famously feisty and curious personality. These two qualities traditionally made the bird an easy food source for Māori and early European settlers. Historically, the weka was a significant resource for some iwi, and the birds’ availability for sustainable harvest (mahinga kai) remains an important issue in weka conservation. Weka were also used by early European settlers, who gave it the name woodhen. The weka’s best known call is a repetitive, loud ‘coo-et’ that is usually heard at dusk and in the early evening. It is presented as a duet, with the male giving the lower and slower part. Weka are usually heard, not seen, although some birds, usually those living near farms or tramping huts, get a reputation for pilfering crops, food and other small objects. They will take the objects to the nearest cover to investigate them. For this reason it is best not to chase weka but to simply watch where the weka goes and retrieve the objects a little later. Weka have demonstrated that under good conditions and with high food availability, they can be very productive with year-round breeding recorded at several sites. However, pairs in other stable populations breed once a year or less. The decline and destabilisation of weka populations on mainland New Zealand, which has resulted in legal protection, has inhibited mahinga kai in modern times. Some iwi today welcome conservation projects that would potentially enable the restoration of harvesting while others believe that the time for harvest has gone. The only place where the legal harvest of weka can occur is on the Chatham Islands and on some islands around Stewart Island."

    description: "The kiwi is a unique and curious bird: it cannot fly, has loose, hair-like feathers, strong legs and no tail. Learn more about the kiwi, the national icon of New Zealand and unofficial national emblem. There are about 68,000 kiwi left in all of New Zealand. We are losing 2% of our unmanaged kiwi every year –that's around 20 per week. Kiwi are mostly nocturnal. They are most commonly forest dwellers, making daytime dens and nests in burrows, hollow logs or under dense vegetation. Kiwi are the only bird to have nostrils at the end of their very long bill. Their nostrils are used to probe in the ground, sniffing out invertebrates to eat, along with some fallen fruit. They also have one of the largest egg-to-body weight ratios of any bird. The egg averages 15% of the female's body weight (compared to 2% for the ostrich). Females are larger than males (up to 3.3 kg and 45 cm). Kiwi are long-lived, and depending on the species live for between 25 and 50 years. Kiwi are a significant national icon, equally cherished by all cultures in New Zealand. Kiwi are a symbol for the uniqueness of New Zealand wildlife and the value of our natural heritage. The bird itself is a taonga (treasure) to Maori, who have strong cultural, spiritual and historic associations with kiwi. Its feathers are valued in weaving kahukiwi (kiwi feather cloak) for people of high rank."

Males are olive green, with a purplish head and black outer wing and tail feathers. Bellbirds are unique to New Zealand, occurring on the three main islands, many offshore islands and also the Auckland Islands. Bellbirds live in native forest (including mixed podocarp-hardwood and beech forest) and regenerating forest, especially where there is diverse or dense vegetation. They can be found close to the coast or in vegetation up to about 1200 metres. In the South Island they have been found inhabiting plantations of eucalypts, pines or willows. They can be spotted in urban areas, especially if there is bush nearby.Typically they require forest and scrub habitats, reasonable cover and good local food sources during the breeding season, since they do not travel far from the nest. However, outside the breeding season they may travel many kilometres to feed, especially males. Bellbird song comprises three distinct sounds resembling the chiming of bells.They sing throughout the day, but more so in the early morning and late evening. The alarm call is a series of loud, rapidly repeated, harsh staccato notes."

    description: "Most terns are seabirds but the black-fronted tern lives and breeds inland, only visiting the coast to feed in autumn and winter. Breeding on a riverbed is a risky business. Many eggs and chicks do not survive. Riverbed birds have adapted to cope with floods and are able to renest if eggs or chicks are lost. This is an important adaptation for breeding in an unstable environment where floods are common. Terns and gulls nest in colonies on open shingle. This gives parent birds a better chance of noticing approaching predators. Groups of birds are better able to scare them off. Their eggs and chicks are also well camouflaged. But, unlike other species, young gulls and terns must remain near the nest, relying on parents to bring food until they can fly and hunt for themselves.Birds that find and hold good nesting sites are more likely to raise chicks successfully."

Fernbirds are closely related to the grassbirds Megalurus of Australia and Africa, and are sometimes included in that genus. They have disappeared from large areas of New Zealand, including Wairarapa, Wellington and Canterbury, but remain common on the West Coast and in pockets of suitable habitat from Northland to Stewart Island. Fernbirds occupy dry shrubland and tussock habitat at a few sites, including in the Far North and on some islands.Fernbirds have declined significantly since humans began draining wetlands and are now classed globally as at risk, declining. Fernbirds are small (18 cm, 35 g), long-tailed songbirds that are predominantly streaked brown above and pale below. The mainland subspecies have a chestnut cap and a prominent pale superciliary stripe. The loosely-barbed plain brown tail feathers have a distinctive tattered appearance. Fernbirds are poor fliers; they typically scramble through dense vegetation, though occasionally fly short distances with their tail hanging down, just above the vegetation. No banded birds have moved more than 5 km, but fernbirds occasionally turn up at sites tens of kilometres from known populations."

The grey warbler/riroriro are found throughout New Zealand. They are a small grey-brown bird with pale grey on the face throat and breast and an off white belly and under tail. Weighing about 6.5g, which is around one-third the weight of a mouse, makes them one of New Zealand's lightest birds. They are insectivores with a habit of hovering to pick insects and spiders from plants. Grey warblers are clever nest builders. They have distinctive domed hanging nests with a small side entrance hole. They are one of few native passerines to have benefitted from human modification of the landscape."

Once common throughout New Zealand, kaka are now largely limited to a few localised forest strongholds in the central North and South Island. Often nesting in holes in trees, kaka chicks stand little chance when attacked by rats, stoats and possums. Kaka have a brush tongue to take nectar from flowers. Their strong bill can open the tough cone of the kauri to obtain seeds. They also use their bill as a “third leg” to assist them when climbing trees to reach food. They make extensive use of their feet to hold food and to hang from branches to reach fruit and flowers. Size: 45 cm; males 475 g, females 425 g (North Island kaka); males 575 g, females 500 g (South Island kaka). Both sub-species have brown/green feathers with brilliant flashes of orange and scarlet under their wings. The South Island kaka, however, has more vivid colouring and is larger in size. When Europeans first arrived in New Zealand, they found kaka in abundance through out the forests of both islands, but by 1930 the birds were localised to a few areas. Today, they are still reasonably common in the Whirinaki, and Pureora forest parks, but even within these strongholds, numbers are thought to be declining. Other large forested areas are almost empty of kaka."

Large, flightless and nocturnal, the kākāpō is an eccentric parrot which can live for decades. It is not closely related to other parrots and, in fact, has a combination of biological features not shared by any other species. It is the only representative of a unique sub-family, Strigops habroptila, and the softness of its plumage is represented in the second part of that scientific name. With mottled moss-green feathers, camouflage is its main form of defence. Kākāpō are the heaviest parrot in the world. Males can weigh over 2 kg. Unique among land birds, it can store large amounts of energy as body fat. Kākāpō is the only parrot to have a 'lek' mating system: males compete for 'calling posts' specially dug-out bowls in the earth and call each night in summer months for a female. The male’s low-frequency mating boom travels over several kilometres. It is the only parrot to have an inflatable thoracic air sac. Kākāpō breed every 2 - 4 years. A bird can walk several km in one night. Although it cannot fly, it is good at climbing trees. The birds are herbivores and eat variety of foods such as roots, leaves and fruit. Kākāpō once lived from near sea level to high in the mountains. Possibly as defence against its ancient predator - the giant eagle - the kākāpō became nocturnal and learned to remain still ('freeze') at times of danger."

They are the world's only alpine parrot, and one of the most intelligent birds. To survive in the harsh alpine environment kea have become inquisitive and nomadic social birds - characteristics which help them to find and utilise new food sources. Kea nest on the ground, and monitoring indicates up to 60% of nests can be attacked by predators during breeding. Kea grow up to 50 cm long and although mostly vegetarian, also enjoy grubs and insects. The kea is related to the forest kaka (Nestor meridionalis). It is thought to have developed its own special characteristics during the last great ice age, by using its unusual powers of curiosity in its search for food in a harsh landscape.Nests are usually found among boulders in high altitude forest where the birds lay between two and four eggs during the breeding season from July and January."

Their status is Native, Not Threatened. Kingfishers are found throughout the country in both coastal and inland freshwater habitats. They live in a wide range of habitats, including forest, river margins, farmland, lakes, estuaries and rocky coastlines. Nest sites are in cavities in trees, cliffs and banks with breeding from September to February. After leaving the nest chicks are fed by both parents for 7–10 days before they start to catch food for themselves. Kingfishers appear to have high fidelity to breeding sites. The same burrow has been reported in use for 20 consecutive years, but it is not known how many birds were involved."

There are two sub-species of kokako, the North Island kokako (Callaeas wilsoni) and the South Island kokako (Callaeas cinerea). It is a dark bluish-grey bird with a long tail and short wings. There is a pair of brightly coloured, fleshy wattles extending from either side of its gape to meet below the neck. The North Island kokako has blue wattles, the South Island kokako has orange or yellow wattles. The bird is not very good at flying, and prefers to use its powerful legs to leap and run through the forest. In Maori myth, it was the kokako that gave Maui water as he fought the sun. The kokako filled its wattles with water and brought it to Maui. His thirst quenched, Maui rewarded the kokako by making its legs long and slender, enabling the bird to bound through the forest with ease in search of food."

Often heard in the forest at dusk and throughout the night, the morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae) is known for its haunting, melancholic call. Its Māori name, ruru, reflects this call. The much larger laughing owl became extinct in the 20th century. The German or little owl is a smaller species often found on open and lightly wooded farmland. It was introduced to New Zealand between 1906 and 1910 to try to control smaller introduced birds. Morepork are commonly found in forests throughout mainland New Zealand and on offshore islands. They are less common within the drier open regions of Canterbury and Otago. They are classified as not threatened. Morepork are speckled brown with yellow eyes set in a dark facial mask. They have a short tail. The females are bigger than the males. Head to tail they measure around 29 cm and the average weight is about 175 g. They have acute hearing and are sensitive to light. They can turn their head through 270 degrees. In Māori tradition the morepork was seen as a watchful guardian. It belonged to the spirit world as it is a bird of the night. Although the more-pork or ruru call was thought to be a good sign, the high pitched, piercing, ‘yelp’ call was thought to be an ominous forewarning of bad news or events."

One of 38 species of falcon worldwide, the New Zealand falcon is endemic to this country. The falcon has a wide distribution, being found on both the North and South Islands and several offshore islands, including Stewart Island and the subantarctic Auckland Islands. Recently, plantation pine forests have been found to be important breeding habitats for falcons. The highest known density of the species is found in Kaingaroa pine forest in the central North Island. Like all falcons, the New Zealand falcon does not build a nest. Rather, it makes a scrape on the ground, under a rocky outcrop or in an epiphyte in an emergent forest tree into which it lays its eggs. A typical clutch consists of 2–4 eggs which take about 33 days to hatch. Nestlings are fed by both parents but the male does most of the hunting with the female guarding close to the nest until the nestlings are close to fledging, which occurs between 31 and 45 days after hatching."

There are two species of native pigeon: the New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) known to the Maori as kererū, or in Northland as kūkū or kūkupa; and the Chatham Islands pigeon (Hemiphaga chathamensis) or parea. While kererū are not threatened, parea are considered nationally vulnerable. Two other kinds of native pigeon became extinct on Raoul Island and Norfolk Island last century, probably due to hunting and predation. Kererū are large birds and can measure up to 51 cm from tail to beak, and weigh about 650 g. Parea are around 20% heavier. Since the extinction of the moa, the kererū and parea are now the only seed dispersers with a bill big enough to swallow large fruit, such as those of karaka, miro, tawa and taraire. The disappearance of these birds could be a disaster for the regeneration of our native forests. The birds also eats leaves, buds and flowers, the relative amounts varying seasonally and regionally, eg in Northland they eat mostly fruit."

Pūkeko are commonly seen along marshy roadsides and low-lying open country, the bird's range has increased with agricultural development. Unlike many other native birds, the pūkeko has adapted well to new habitats, such as grassed paddocks, croplands and even city parks, a necessity brought about by disappearing wetlands. However, the pūkeko is essentially a bird of swampy ground, lagoons, reeds, rushes and swamps. Pūkeko can be aggressive and territorial. They're mostly vegetarian, but also eat invertebrates, eggs, frogs, small fish, chicks and mammals, especially in breeding season where chicks are fed protein-rich animals. They are widespread and have adapted well to urbanisation - they are as at home in pasture and farmland as they are in wetlands. Pūkeko are cooperative breeders, with multiple male and female birds often sharing a nest and responsibility for incubation of eggs and the guarding and feeding of chicks."

But apart from diet, hihi share few qualities with tui and bellbird, which are members of the honeyeater family. DNA analysis has shown that hihi are in fact the sole representative of another bird family found only in New Zealand whose closest relatives may be the iconic wattlebirds that include kokako, saddleback and the extinct huia. Male and female hihi look quite different. The male flaunts a flashy plumage of black head with white ‘ear’ tufts, bright yellow shoulder bars and breast bands and a white wing bar and has a mottled tan-grey-brown body. The female is more subdued with an olive-grey-brown body cover, white wing bars and small white ‘ear’ tufts. They both have small cat-like whiskers around the beak and large bright eyes. Hihi can be recognised by their posture of an upward tilted tail and strident call from which the name ‘stitchbird’ derives. A 19th century ornithologist Sir Walter Buller described the call made by the male hihi as resembling the word ‘stitch’. This call sounds a little like two stones being repeatedly stuck together. Both males and females also have a range of warble-like calls and whistles."

They are very vocal; loud piping is used in territorial interactions and when alarmed. Chicks are warned of danger with a sharp, loud ‘chip’ or ‘click’. Their status is 'Endemic, Recovering'. Adults have black upperparts, their underparts vary from all black, through a range of ‘smudgy’ intermediate states to white. The proportion of all-black birds increases as you head south.

Once common throughout New Zealand, kakī is now restricted to the braided rivers and wetlands of the Mackenzie Basin, South Island. Kakī are critically endangered. Kakī have completely black plumage and long red legs. Young kakī have black and white plumage until 18 months old, when they become all black. Kakī are found in braided riverbeds, side streams, swamps and tarns and sometimes on lake margins and irrigated paddocks if there is good feed available. Most riverbed birds migrate to the coast in winter, but kakī usually continue to feed on the parts of river and delta which do not freeze over. Kakī are opportunistic feeders, mostly taking aquatic insects, molluscs and small fish. They can wade out into deeper, slower moving water than most riverbed birds, reaching reach down to catch insects, such as mayfly and caddisfly larvae, on the river bottom. Sometimes they dart at insects and small fish in shallow rapids or muddy areas. Unlike pied stilts and other waders, they can also feed by using a scything motion with their bill."
